### Easy OSX -> Linux Dev

This is a Vagrant File that will forward common ports (8080 and 3000) to develop applications with shared folders

The shared folders I have need to be modified to mimic the folders you want to share with your machine.

In this machine I use [DevOpsOne](https://github.com/selfup/DevOpsOne) to setup my ruby/rails/python/node/postgres environment. So I auto git clone that repo for anyone to use!

Feel free to check out the link. It is super easy to use!

Here is how to set up the VM using my scripts: https://gist.github.com/selfup/24d5901b0610fdbf7692

**Please make sure to change lines 14-16 to mimic folders on your machine!**

Enjoy!
