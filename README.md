### Easy OSX -> Linux Dev

This is a Vagrant File that will forward common ports (8080 and 3000) to develop applications with shared folders

The shared folder I have need to be modified to mimic the folders you want to share with your machine.

In this machine I use [DevOpsOne](https://github.com/selfup/DevOpsOne) to setup my ruby/rails/python/node/postgres environment.

Please make sure to change lines 14-16 to mimic folders on your machine!

Enjoy!
